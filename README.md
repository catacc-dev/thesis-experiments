# mythesisprojects

Here are the tests that I have done before starting to implement my master's thesis code with MONAI.

Jupyter Notebooks functions:

"processing-synthrad-2023-images":
1. Loads data
2. Preprocess with MONAI specificities - ensure channel as the first dimension, resampling and normalise MRI and CT to a range of -1 and 1.
3. Visualise some slices of each image.
